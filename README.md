## Project Overview

### Project Description

In this assignment, I tackled the task of classifying skin lesions using deep learning models. The goal was to develop models capable of accurately identifying different types of skin conditions based on image data. I used PyTorch to develop Deep Learning models and Weight and Bias to visualize results.

### Results and Experiments

All the detailed results and experiments are documented in the "CSE3001 Assignment Report.docx" file. Make sure to refer to this document for a comprehensive overview of the project's findings, insights, and evaluation metrics.


## Getting Started

If someone wants to replicate or build upon your work, provide instructions on how to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nminhquang380/CSE3001
    cd CSE3001
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in the "CSE3001 Assignment Report.docx" document to understand and reproduce the experiments.
